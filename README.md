## CODENAME: Bitchfork Server

Still working on a name here.

This is just a file with some Koa endpoints in it. It has JWT auth and you
can create reviews and then fetch all of them. It's enough for a POC for
the app.

I cannot stress enough how unsecure this is.

`node index.js`

requires:

`export MONGO_HOST="mongodb://blahblahblah/blah"`
